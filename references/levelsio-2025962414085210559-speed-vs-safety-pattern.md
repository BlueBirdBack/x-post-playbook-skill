# Speed vs Safety Pattern (levelsio 2025962414085210559)

## Core pattern

A productivity shortcut removes permission friction and increases speed, but also removes a key safety guardrail.

## Extraction template for similar posts

When a post claims "I became 10x/100x faster" via bypassing safeguards, extract:

1. **What was bypassed?**
   - approvals, sandbox, tests, reviews, etc.

2. **What speed gain is plausible?**
   - lower prompt/approval friction, fewer context switches

3. **What failure modes increase?**
   - destructive commands, wrong-path edits, production blast radius

4. **What is the safe operating boundary?**
   - disposable sandbox vs production/personal machine

## Recommended response style

- Validate the productivity insight.
- Explicitly call out risk.
- Offer a safer compromise: scoped temporary bypass, then revert to guarded mode.
