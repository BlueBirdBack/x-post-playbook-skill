## Distilled pattern

1. **Link intake → Issue queue**
   - When a useful post is found, push it into an issue/task queue immediately.
   - Goal: avoid losing ideas in chat scrollback.

2. **Comment mining for hard problems**
   - Use the post URL to pull comments/replies.
   - Extract strong questions, edge cases, and expert tactics.
   - Convert top findings into experiments or reply drafts.

3. **Timeline fetch for context sync**
   - Pull latest posts from the target account to keep context fresh.
   - Use this to discuss or critique new posts without manual copy-paste.

4. **One tool, multiple surfaces**
   - Use one unified fetch flow for:
     - post text
     - comments/replies
     - user timeline
     - article links

## Operational takeaway

Treat social content as an execution pipeline, not passive reading:
**capture → structure → assign → review**.

## Failure modes to watch

- Capturing too much, executing too little
- Pulling comments without ranking relevance
- Mixing insight collection with no clear owner/task

## Minimal implementation checklist

- [ ] Define one intake channel (URL dropbox)
- [ ] Auto-create issue/task from each URL
- [ ] Add one daily review slot to execute top 1–3 items
- [ ] Keep a small scorecard (completed tasks, useful hits, dead ends)
